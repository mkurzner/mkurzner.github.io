I enjoy sharing astronomy and data-driven science with broader audiences and have participated in public talks, online outreach, and community science events throughout my PhD.

My outreach focuses on making galaxy evolution, astronomical imaging, and data analysis accessible to non-specialist audiences, including students and community groups.

## Public Talks and Events

  *June 24, 2023 (public talk, general audience)*  
  Talk: *How Galaxies Shape Up: From Cosmic Collisions to Quiet Growth*

- **Community and School Outreach (Online and In-Person)**  
  - Guest talks for high school science classes   
  - Informal Q&A sessions on careers in science and data analysis

- **Regional Science Fair Support**  
  - Assisted with judging and student feedback at local science fairs  
  - Provided mentoring on experimental design and data presentation

## Media

- **Podcast Guest — Beyond the Jargon (CFUV 101.9 FM, University of Victoria)**  
  Episode: *Galaxy Clusters with Max Kurzner*  
  Discussion of galaxy clusters, astronomical surveys, and what it’s like to do research in astrophysics.

## Why I value outreach

Engaging with non-specialist audiences has been one of the most rewarding parts of my graduate training. Explaining technical ideas clearly and intuitively has directly strengthened how I communicate research, teach students, and collaborate across disciplines.
