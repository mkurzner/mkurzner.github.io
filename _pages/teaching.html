I have served as a teaching assistant for multiple undergraduate astronomy courses at the University of Victoria and Tufts University, supporting students across a wide range of quantitative and computational backgrounds.

My teaching focuses on helping students build intuition for physical concepts while developing practical problem-solving and data analysis skills.

## University of Victoria — Teaching Assistant (2021–2024)

**Courses:**  
- ASTR 101 — Introduction to Astronomy  
- ASTR 150 — Concepts in Modern Astronomy

**Responsibilities:**  
- Led weekly laboratory sections (≈20–30 students per section)  
- Taught quantitative reasoning, basic coding, and data interpretation  
- Provided one-on-one and small-group mentoring during office hours  
- Graded assignments and provided structured feedback on methods and reasoning

## Tufts University — Teaching Assistant (2020–2021)

**Courses:**  
- AST 09 — The Modern Universe (large lecture, ≈100 students)  
- AST32 - Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy (Upper-level undergraduate astronomy course, ≈20 students)

**Responsibilities:**  
- Supported instruction in lecture and laboratory settings  
- Helped design and troubleshoot hands-on data analysis exercises  
- Assisted students with conceptual understanding and exam preparation

## Teaching philosophy (brief)

I aim to make technical material approachable by connecting abstract concepts to concrete examples and real data. I place particular emphasis on helping students develop confidence in quantitative reasoning and computational tools, especially for those encountering them for the first time.
