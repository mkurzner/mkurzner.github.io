Hi and welcome to my website! My name is Max Kuzner and I am currently a PhD Candidate in Astrophysics at the University of Victoria, focusing on Galaxy Morphology. If you are here after meeting me in person or hearing me give a talk, let's get in touch, all of my contact info is on the sidebar on the left! If you have found your way here another way then kudos to you and please do stick around! Now that we have gotten the basics out of the way, allow me to tell you a bit more about what I am currently working on!
