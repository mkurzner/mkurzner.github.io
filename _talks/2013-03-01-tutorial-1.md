I presented a contributed talk at AAS 241 on  preliminary results from my morphological catalogue and analysis of all galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. During this 5-minute presentation, I highlighted notable forthcoming results from the NGVS and discussed how our comprehensive morphological census will provide unprecedented insights into the diverse galaxy populations in Virgo.
